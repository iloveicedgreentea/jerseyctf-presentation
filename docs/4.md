## Getting Into Cloud Security

![](../img/money.jpg)

### A Day in The Life

I can give you some more context about Cloud Security by mentioning some things I have worked on in the last year:

* Writing tools to automate remediation of various security findings
* Creating TDDs for cloud security strategy, policies, etc
* Rearchitecting a very large bank's GCP cloud security strategy 
* Designing data security frameworks
* Writing security best practices Terraform
* Compliance assessments

Keep in mind, this is with a consulting company so most internal employees would not get a chance to have this much variety day to day.

### Entrypoints

First of all, you don't need 1, 3, or 5 years of experience like some job postings demand. Everyone is desperate to hire competent people. If you can prove you know what you are talking about at your level, you will get a job.

However, you do need that solid foundational knowledge as mentioned before. 

There are many paths one can take to end up in the field of Cloud Security:

* Starting as a sysadmin who eventually learns code and how to secure things

* Starting as a developer, and eventually how to write secure code

* Jumping into "security research" a.k.a hacking things and hoping not to get arrested

There is no one right way to start. All that matters is you understand code, ops, and best practices. You don't need to be a generalist. For example, if you have a CS degree and want to code, you can focus on application security in the cloud. If you don't like to code and want to stick to ops, you can focus on automating compliance or securing supply chains.

### Career Paths And Certs

Here are some career paths with accompanying certs to get:

* Working at a CSP
  * CSP's cloud certs
* Security Engineering
  * Your company's CSP certs. If you use AWS, get AWS certs
* Governance/Compliance/Auditing
  * CISM, PCIP, CISSP
* Consulting
  * Everything
