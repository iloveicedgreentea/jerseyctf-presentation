### What Is Security?

![](../img/skills1.jpg)
(this is a joke)

"Security", as a field, is not a separate branch of IT like "devops" or database administration, in that its not a separate skillset you develop. Security requires a very wide range of foundational knowledge. You have to understand how the things work to secure them.

A well-rounded security professional should have a good understanding of some code, how to automate things, devops, databases, web apps, etc. Understanding these things are essential to develop the [context](#a-note-on-context) needed to secure them and explain to stakeholders why they need to care.

### What Is Cloud Security?

Cloud Security is just the application of "security" to resources running in the cloud. While the specific implementations of security don't always translate from non-cloud to cloud security, the concepts are still relevant (least privilege, network security, etc).

For cloud security specifically, you need this wide range of foundational knowledge in addition to a deep understanding of how the cloud works.

### A Note On Context

Context means understanding the how, why, and when of something. If you don't understand how to architect a three tiered application, or how MySQL authentication works, or the difference between ECC and RSA, you won't be able to make good decisions or provide guidance. The key take-away here is you need to understand the consequences of choosing one thing over the other to be a trusted advisor. 

An essential skill is transferring your implicit context to someone else. When you know something, you don't think about the 15 other related concepts that are required to understand that thing. This is the implicit knowledge in your head. When you talk to someone and try to explain why ECC keys are a better choice than RSA keys, that person may not even understand why a key size matters, or what asymmetric encryption is, while these things are implicitly known to you. You need to be able to convey the message with the proper context.
