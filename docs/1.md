## Introduction
This talk is an overview of Cloud Security, some concepts of the cloud, and getting into Cloud Security as a profession.

I am a senior cloud security consultant at [ScaleSec](https://scalesec.com/), assistant director of R&D at [CSNP](https://www.csnp.org/). I also did the engineering for this CTF which will get open sourced sometime this week.
