## Cloud Computing is The Way Forward

![](../img/thanos.jpg)

Cloud Computing provides flexibility and elasticity that is not possible to match with on-prem hardware.

You don't need to think about buying servers, hard drives, switches, etc, because that's someone else's problem. 

Think about the other really hard problems to solve on-prem:
  * IAM 
  * Logging
  * Monitoring metrics
  * Audit logging
  * Networking - SDNs, VPNs, routing, global availability

All of these things are managed for you in a CSP (Cloud Service Provider). On-prem, you would need to write custom tooling or integrations with vendor solutions.
